in order of importance:

 - (probably) fix TLS on win32
 - (maybe) fix libvncclient calls bailing out with EINTR on
   UNIX because of SIGRT_1, which seems to be blockable on 
   some machines, on some not.
 - general code cleanup (use wxThreadHelper, custom events)
 - multiple connections at once, like the other multivnc
 - ability to choose encodings
 - more tooltips
 - translations
