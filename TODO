in order of importance:
 - fix hang when connection is disrupted
 - make VNC server on win32 exit when window is closed
 - fix TLS on win32, this is a problem in libvncclient (read/write vs recv/send??)
 - fix the seamless connector for win32.
 - make it work on OS X
 - textchat
 - server side scaling
 - multiple connections at once, like the other multivnc
 - more tooltips
 - translations
 - new drawing model:

                  wxBitmap(per viewerwindow) -> (wxImage-> scaled wxImage -> wxBitmap) -> screen
                /
cl->framebuffer
                \
                  gl texture(per viewerwindow) -> screen (via wxGLCanvas -> FAST scaling)
                  
 read directly cl->framebuffer into wxBitmap/texture WITHOUT an intermediate wxBitmap object

 per viewerwindow wxBitmap/texture to screen happens at fixed interval so no more overload of
 drawing engine

 - stutter when using stats on win32 -> seems to be caused by
   SendXvpMessage(), but why? testrect case is ok...
