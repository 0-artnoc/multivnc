<h1>Using MultiVNC</h1>
Welcome to the MultiVNC help page! This will give a short introduction on the viewer's basic operation.

<h2>Basic Control</h2>
After connecting, you start out in View mode, where you can actually see the remote desktop. Your pointer will be <b>highlighted</b> by a
purple circle - you can turn that feature off via the menu. At the bottom of the screen will be three <b>virtual mouse buttons</b>. These can
also be turned off, but you will want to use them, as they enable you to drag things around on the remote desktop. When disabled, a single
tap anywhere on the screen will emulate a left mouse button click. A double tap will send a right mouse button click to the remote side. The
<b>keyboard</b> can be toggled on and off via the menu or ActionBar.

<h2>Scaling</h2>
Zooming in and out of the screen is hardware accelerated via OpenGL and can be initiated with two ways: First is simply with a two-finger
<b>pinch gesture</b>, like in Android photo gallery. On low-end devices that do not support multitouch, zooming can also be initiated by a long-press
anywhere on the screen - zoom controls will then appear.

<h2>Touchpad Mode</h2>
This is a <b>really fast</b> remote control mode specific to MultiVNC where no screen contents are transmitted at all. Intended for situations
where you do not need to see the remote screen, e. g. for remote controlling your laptop connected to a projector from your phone during a
presentation.



<h2>Bookmarking</h2>
If you want to bookmark the current connection, simply tap the bookmark save entry. A bookmark will be created for later access.
