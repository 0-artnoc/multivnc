how to compile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

the prerequisites:

- the usual c-compiler with headers and stuff
- wxWidgets dev package version >= 2.8.7
- zlib dev package 
- libjpeg dev package 

to compile:

./autogen.sh


if crosscompiling with MinGW:


./autogen.sh --build=<your build system type> --host=i586-mingw32msvc --with-wx-config=<your win32 wx-config> --with-zlib=<path to where zlib include and lib dirs are>

then


make


and cross fingers


to install:
- 'make install' as root
- or copy binary wherever you like to



that's pretty much it, have fun !
