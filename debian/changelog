multivnc (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release 0.4.
     - MultiVNC can now connect to IPv6 servers!
     - MulticastVNC now incorporates a NACK mechanism which makes
       multicasting a lot more reliable: Lost packets are 
       retransmitted if the server supports it.
     - MultiVNC now supports QoS: data sent to a VNC server can be
       marked for expedited forwarding!
     - Fixed bug where changing edge connector settings would
       crash MultiVNC.
