multivnc (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release 0.5.
     - MulticastVNC now supports the Ultra encoding and features
       a freely sizeable receive buffer in addition to the 
       OS-dependent socket receive buffer.
     - The new MulticastVNC flow control adapts the server's
       transmission rate to the capabilities of the network
       and clients.
     - MultiVNC is now able to connect to Apple Remote Desktop
       servers.
     - It is now possible to select the desired VNC encoding.
     - This time really fixed the bug with the viewer becoming
       unresponsive under high multicast loads.

multivnc (0.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release 0.4.1.
     - Changed default MulticastVNC receive buffer size to 5120 KB
       to play it safe.
     - Shared windows are now view-only on Linux clients. Having
       the local cursor warped here and there is quite distracting.
     - Window sharing on Windows has no more trayicon and
       distracting setup dialog.
     - Window sharing should be more stable now.
     - Link latency measuring is way more exact now.
     - Fixed crash on startup when toolbar was disabled.
     - Fixed Windows build. MultiVNC 0.4 was unusable.

multivnc (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release 0.4.
     - MultiVNC can now connect to IPv6 servers!

       multicasting a lot more reliable: Lost packets are
       retransmitted if the server supports it.
     - MultiVNC now supports QoS: data sent to a VNC server can be
       marked for expedited forwarding!
     - Fixed bug where changing edge connector settings would
       crash MultiVNC.

    - Fixed bug where setting up connection would take very long
      due to unnecessary DNS lookups.
