MultiVNC 0.3 - "Collab me!"
	* Implemented window sharing: You can now beam one of your 
          windows to the remote side.
        * The Mac OS X version is now in a working state.
	* Fixed a bug where a fast VNC server would make MultiVNC
	  GUI unresponsive on a slow client.
	* Fixed bug where saving log or screenshot would terminate
	  the connection or even crash on some machines.
        * Fixed bug where setting up connection would take very long
          due to unnecessary DNS lookups.


MultiVNC 0.2 - "The real thing"
	* MulticastVNC incorporated! You can now connect to a
 	  MulticastVNC enabled server, e.g. based on libvncserver.
	* Listen mode (Reverse VNC) implemented. Via tabs it is
	  possible to listen for and serve multiple incoming
	  connections.
        * Bookmarks are working now.
	* Clipboard data is now properly encoded.
	* Fix bug with canvas centering.
	* Fix bug where disconnecting from a fast server would 
 	  terminate MultiVNC.
        * Fix really nasty bug where listening on windows would
          take 100% CPU.


MultiVNC 0.1 - "In the beginning"
	* a usable tight-enabled vncviewer with the following special
	  features:
	* supports server framebuffer resize
	* several connections with one viewer using tabs
	* simple, loggable statistics
        * discovery of VNC servers advertising themselves via ZeroConf
        * runs under UNIX and Windows
