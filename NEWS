MultiVNC 0.4 - "One for the road"
        * MultiVNC can now connect to IPv6 servers!
        * MulticastVNC now incorporates a NACK mechanism which makes
          multicasting a lot more reliable: Lost packets are 
          retransmitted if the server supports it.
        * MultiVNC now supports QoS: data sent to a VNC server can be
          marked for expedited forwarding!
        * Fixed bug where changing edge connector settings would
          crash MultiVNC.

MultiVNC 0.3 - "Collab me!"
	* Implemented window sharing: You can now beam one of your 
          windows to the remote side. Works on UNIX and Windows.
        * Implemented Edge Connector: You can now tell MultiVNC that
          one of your screen edges should be the border to the remote
          display. When you move the pointer over this edge, MultiVNC
          will take over your mouse and keyboard and send your input 
          to the remote side. When the pointer is moved back towards 
          the opposite edge on the remote screen, you're back on your
          local desktop.
 	* Implemented FastRequest feature: You can now set an interval
 	  at which MultiVNC continously asks the server for updates
	  instead of just asking after each received server message.
	  This should improve framerate on high latency links.
	* Fixed a bug where a fast VNC server would make MultiVNC
	  GUI unresponsive on a slow client.
	* Fixed bug where saving log or screenshot would terminate
	  the connection or even crash on some machines.
        * Fixed bug where setting up connection would take very long
          due to unnecessary DNS lookups.


MultiVNC 0.2 - "The real thing"
	* MulticastVNC incorporated! You can now connect to a
 	  MulticastVNC enabled server, e.g. based on libvncserver.
	* Listen mode (Reverse VNC) implemented. Via tabs it is
	  possible to listen for and serve multiple incoming
	  connections.
        * Bookmarks are working now.
	* Clipboard data is now properly encoded.
	* Fix bug with canvas centering.
	* Fix bug where disconnecting from a fast server would 
 	  terminate MultiVNC.
        * Fix really nasty bug where listening on windows would
          take 100% CPU.


MultiVNC 0.1 - "In the beginning"
	* a usable tight-enabled vncviewer with the following special
	  features:
	* supports server framebuffer resize
	* several connections with one viewer using tabs
	* simple, loggable statistics
        * discovery of VNC servers advertising themselves via ZeroConf
        * runs under UNIX and Windows
